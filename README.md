Use the CodeSandbox link above to preview this repository.

This is a temporary replacement for a DateTime Picker using [shadcn ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/select) components/theming. This repo utilizes react-aria's [useDatePicker](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useDatePicker.html) for the accessible date & time components

**Please submit PR's to improve this repository! I am by no means an expert in DateTime & accessiblility standards**

Hope this serves as a nice starting point.
